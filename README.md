## This is a small fullstack development project, a todo list.

### Setup:

- Clone repo
- Install dependencies
- Database, you can use any but I have used [mySQL server and workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/8.0.html)
- Read the [prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started) how to setup prisma with your database.
- When you have setup an emty database, create two tables. Id and todos.

## `npm start`

Start the development server.

## `nodemon server.js`

Start the server. This needs to be running when you want to communicate with the database from the website or with a desktop app such as [postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download)

##

After this you should be able to open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and add todos.
